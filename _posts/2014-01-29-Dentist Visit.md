Today is the day, that ELijah goes to the dentist! A big trip for a little guy! I dont remember my first trip to the dentist office, but I remember hating them as I got older. Who doesn't? 
Anyway, prior to this visit, I have worked hard cleaning the house. Started with dishes, the kitchen, and of coure the tables, and worked my way to laundry! I have to do an unimaginable amount of laundry, because our beagle has this uncanny way, of somehow, making everything in our home smell like him! Not only does that gross us out, but I'm sure those around us, dont appreciate it too much either. Soon enough, I will defeat the Nacho Cheese Doritos musk he naturally creates out of the fibers that reside in our home! Also, I decided to give the little man a hair cut, and make him look stylish, and well... enjoy the photo! I figured I'd stop and post something while I get ready for the rest of the day, and while Elijah naps before his big mean visit soon!
