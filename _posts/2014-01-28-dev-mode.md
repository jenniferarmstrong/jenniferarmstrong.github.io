Alright, so since Im just getting familiar with how this works, and still have lots to accomplish, this will be my last post for the night. It's also getting late, and my eyes are burning! With that being said, I just want to say for those of you reading and checking the updates, bare with me. Since this is still in Dev. mode or _Developement mode_ for those that dont speak techy, changes and updates are frequent. 



If there is a lag or something you find buggy, or broken, dont hesitate to let me know. I am super proud of the progress I've made tonight and again, I plan to update things as frequently as possible, with the exception of my hectic, attention demanding life. Enjoy what there is posted, and rememer that this is my new pride and joy! My goal (when it is up and running flawlessly) is to post 3-5 times a day. I'm not sure yet, honestly. I feel like I'm rambling. Regardless, by the end of the day, you'll have something to laugh, smile, cry, giggle, pout, or whatever emotion I may stir in you that day, about.

Hugs and Rainbows to you all! 
And again, don't hesistate to share a blog here or there with the ones you love as well!
