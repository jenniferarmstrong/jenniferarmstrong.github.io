I think this one explains itself. This kid, I tell you, is constantly doing something new, and crazy!
Tonight, it's indeed standing INSIDE of the fridge, deciding what's for dinner. Yea, so, he might've had a little help from daddy, but after daddy decided to _leave him be_ he stayed there (supervised of course) until he picked what it was he wanted. We're talking 5-10mins of just standing, gabbing away, and pointing at all the food choices. He finally settled on string cheese sticks and cherry tomatoes (he later spat onto the floor leading our dog to eat), until mommy ruined his fun, in which I removed the child from the fridge.
